-1.1 Explain the role and function of network components
1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)
	dna - DNA Center provides a single dashboard for every fundamental management task to simplify running your network
		design, policy, provision, assurance, plateform

-1.2 Describe characteristics of network topology architectures
1.2.f On-premises and cloud
	on-premis - one time cost, hosting servers, network device, end points on site
	cloud	  - monthly subscription, hosting servers, network devices, end points in the cloud+

-1.9 Compare IPv6 address types
1.9.a Global unicast
	-eui-64, used mac, add FFFE to middle, flips 7th bit
1.9.b Unique local
	-FE80::/10, eui-64
1.9.c Link local
	-FF02, Derived by device, host the creates the packet can send it onto the link,but no routers forward the packet
1.9.d Anycast
	-shared by two or more devices the exist in different parts of the network, all routers will forward to the nearest of the two servers, 
1.9.e Multicast
	-implies some subnet of all devices currently on lan
1.9.f Modified EUI 64
	-auto ipv6 add, takes mac, adds FFFE to middle, flips 7th bit

-1.11 Describe wireless principles
1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels
	-1,6,11 don't overlap out of the 1-13 channels on 2.4Ghz

1.11.b SSID
	-boradcasted to join wireless network
1.11.c RF
	-radio frequencies, 2.4 and 5 reserved for personal use 
1.11.d Encryption
	WEP - poor security, hard to configure, 
	WPA - poor security, easier to configure, 802.11i, used pre-shared key (PSK)
	WPA2 - good security, easier the WPA to configure, 802.11i, advanced encryption standard (AES), 

-1.13 Describe switching concepts
1.13.a MAC learning and aging
	-known as ARP (adress resolution protocol), broadcast, 5 minute hold time
1.13.b Frame switching
	- source and dest mac add
1.13.c Frame flooding
	- basically braodcast, switch forwards packet out all ports except one recieved on, when switch pretends to be a hub
1.13.d MAC address table 
	- also known as cam table, holds all mac address the device knows how to reach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Configure and verify VLANs (normal range) spanning multiple switches

2.1.a Access ports (data and voice)
2.1.b Default VLAN
2.1.c Connectivity
---------------------- would like to build lab with 1 router 2 swithes in two different networks to show what vlans can do----------------
